# DNRGB LED strip controller
This program sets up an UDP server controlling a LED strip using the DNRGB protocol.

I use this program as part of my custom Ambilight system. It runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero W to control a WS2812B strip of 62 leds placed behind my screen, processing requests generated by [psieg's Unofficial Prismatik Fork](https://github.com/psieg/Lightpack) software.

It uses the [rpi-ws281x-go library](https://github.com/rpi-ws281x/rpi-ws281x-go) to control the Leds.

## Prerequisites
- A device with GPIO ports connected to an individually addressable LEDs strip (e.g. WS2812B), and capable of running executables (e.g. a Raspberry Pi)
- A development environment with go 1.13 (or ulterior) installed

## Configuration
My personnal configuration is currently hardcoded in the project for performance reasons. 
I recommend you to clone/fork this project in order to modify the constants and thus to adapt this project to your needs.

The main settings to tinker with are `main.go`'s constants, namely `port`, `ledCount` and `ledBrightness`.

You may also want to modify the strip configuration options proposed by the [rpi-ws281x-go library](https://github.com/rpi-ws281x/rpi-ws281x-go), located in `strip.go`.

## Usage
- With Go installed, simply use the following command to generate a new executable:
```
go build
```
- Then execute the generated executable on your controller device

*Note: According to your controller's operating system, you may have to execute this program with admin rights.*
